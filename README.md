## Heart Disease Analysis
This project involves analyzing heart disease data to predict the heart disease based on several health-related factors. The analysis is done using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), followed by building an insightful Power BI dashboard to visualize the results and findings.

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to understand the factors that contribute to heart disease, visualize the data, and make predictions based on the patterns observed. The dataset contains various health-related metrics such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more, with a target variable indicating whether a person has heart disease or not.

# Technologies Used
Jupyter Notebook: For data analysis, cleaning, and performing machine learning algorithms.
* Power BI: For data visualization and creating interactive dashboards.
* Python: For data manipulation and analysis using libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.
* SQL: For data extraction and queries.
* Pandas, Numpy: For data cleaning and manipulation.
* Matplotlib, Seaborn: For data visualization.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is publicly available and contains the following columns:

age: Age of the person
sex: Gender of the person (1 = male, 0 = female)
cp: Chest pain type (4 values)
trestbps: Resting blood pressure
chol: Serum cholesterol level
fbs: Fasting blood sugar (1 if > 120 mg/dl, 0 otherwise)
restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results
thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved
exang: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)
oldpeak: Depression induced by exercise relative to rest
slope: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
ca: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
thal: Thalassemia (3 = normal, 6 = fixed defect, 7 = reversible defect)
target: 1 if heart disease is present, 0 if not

# Key Features

* Data Exploration & Preprocessing: Cleaned and explored the dataset to identify missing values, outliers, and trends.

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed correlations between features and the target variable to identify key factors contributing to heart disease.

* Visualization: Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize the analysis and allow insights into heart disease patterns.
